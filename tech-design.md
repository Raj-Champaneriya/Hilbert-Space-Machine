   - Data flows: from sources to processing, to ML engine, to storage, to API, and to monitoring.
   - Integrations: with existing trading systems, risk management, etc.
  
   Let's design with 4 core components:
  
   1. **Data Ingestion & Processing**: Handles data from various sources, normalizes, and prepares for ML.
   2. **Hilbert Space ML Engine**: Performs the core computations, model training, and inference.
   3. **API & Services Layer**: Exposes the ML capabilities via REST/gRPC and integrates with existing systems.
   4. **Observability Suite**: Includes monitoring, logging, and explainability (for compliance and debugging).
  
   We are excluding a separate storage component because:
   - We can leverage existing storage solutions (like a data lake or time-series database) and the ML engine can interface with them.
   - The backlog does not specify a need for a new storage system, so we assume existing infrastructure.
  
   Technology Constraints:
   - Preferred stack: Python (for ML), with possible C++ for performance-critical parts of the Hilbert space operations.
   - Existing systems to leverage: 
        - Market data feeds (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters)
        - Internal databases and data lakes (for historical data)
        - Existing trading and risk management systems (via APIs)
   - Cloud: We assume a cloud environment (AWS/Azure/GCP) for scalability.
  
   Non-Functional Requirements:
   - Performance: Real-time processing for high-frequency data (sub-second latency for some forecasts)
   - Security: Compliance with financial regulations (data encryption, access controls, audit trails)
   - Scalability: Handle increasing data volumes and model complexity
  
   Implementation Phases (aligned with backlog phases):
    Phase 1: Core Forecasting Foundation (Months 1-3)
      - Focus: Data Ingestion, ML Engine (core forecasting models), API for basic forecasts, basic monitoring.
    Phase 2: Advanced Analytics & Integration (Months 4-6)
      - Focus: Enhance ML Engine with more models, expand API for risk and portfolio, improve monitoring.
    Phase 3: Specialized Capabilities (Months 7-9)
      - Focus: Add anomaly detection and sentiment analysis to the ML Engine, enhance API for these features.
    Phase 4: Enhanced Features & Innovation (Months 10-12)
      - Focus: Real-time adaptation, ESG, alternative data, and advanced explainability.
  
   Now, the Mermaid diagram for a single-page architecture:
  
   We'll have 4 main components and the data flows between them, plus external systems.

   Rationale for each component:
  
   1. **Data Ingestion & Processing**:
      - Why: Essential to handle diverse financial data (market data, economic indicators, news, etc.) in real-time and batch.
      - Scope: Normalizes data, handles missing values, and prepares features for the ML engine. Connects to existing data lake for historical data.
      - Technology: Apache Kafka for streaming, Python for processing, leveraging existing data lake (e.g., S3, HDFS).
  
   2. **Hilbert Space ML Engine**:
      - Why: The core of the system, implementing the Hilbert space operations and forecasting models.
      - Scope: Includes model training, inference, and the mathematical operations for forecasting, risk, portfolio optimization, etc. Uses a model registry for versioning.
      - Technology: Python (with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and custom Hilbert space implementations), possibly C++ for performance-critical parts. Leverages GPU acceleration.
  
   3. **API & Services Layer**:
      - Why: To expose the ML capabilities to internal systems (trading, risk management) and users (portfolio managers, analysts).
      - Scope: Provides REST/gRPC endpoints for forecasts, risk metrics, portfolio optimizations, etc. Handles authentication and rate limiting.
      - Technology: FastAPI or gRPC, deployed in containers (Kubernetes for scalability).
  
   4. **Observability Suite**:
      - Why: Critical for monitoring model performance, system health, and providing explainability for regulatory compliance.
      - Scope: Tracks prediction accuracy, system metrics, logs, and generates explanations for model decisions.
      - Technology: Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring, ELK stack for logging, custom explainability modules.
  
   Boundaries:
   - In scope: The four components above, and the integrations with existing data sources and internal systems.
   - Out of scope (future considerations): 
        - Advanced distributed computing (beyond basic scalability)
        - Custom hardware acceleration (beyond standard GPU)
        - Full-fledged data warehouse (we leverage existing data lake)
        - User interface beyond API (existing systems will consume the API)
  
   This architecture is minimal but covers the essential needs for the backlog. It avoids over-engineering by leveraging existing systems and focusing on the core components.
